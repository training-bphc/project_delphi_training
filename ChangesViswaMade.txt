All the changes I made 
If you have any queries or any othe change suggestion please refer these numbers
NOTE - All the new css files created (Table.module.css, createNewRecords.css) are vibe coded

1) In Table.tsx I have created it as a table having colunms 
S.No	Name	BITS ID	Email	Date	Category    Added By    Verified Status
    The Category again have 8 options, Added by have Student and Training Unit Options and Verified Status have yes /no options
    These I will allow them to sort in the backend files 

2) The createNewRecords acts both to search the record or create new record
    The createNewRecords function as both a search and a record creation system. 
        (i)Say a student initiated Record Request (say a hacathon)
            When a student submits a request for training point verification:
                The record is automatically goes into the “View Records for Verification” tab.
                The verification status at this stage is set to "No".
            TU Actions from “View Records for Verification”:
                If TU Accept →
                    Status changes to “Verified – Yes”
                    Record moves to the “Previous Verifications” tab.
                If TU reject (maybe with reason) →
                    Status changes to “Rejected”
                    Record moves to “Pending Records for Verification” (separate filtered view).
                    Student is notified with the rejection reason and allowed to modify/resubmit.

        (ii)Say TU initiated Record Creation
            When TU creates a record directly (say speaker session):
            TU enters the student’s ID in Overview tab.
            If the ID already exists:
                The “Search” button changes to “Modify”, in the overview tab redirecting to the "Pending records for verification" Tab.
            If creating a new entry(i.e. if the ID doesnt exist):
                The "Search" button changes to “Add New”, in the Overview tab, add we will get a pop-up to make new record.
                Records created directly by TU are automatically verified (“Yes”)
                These records immediately appear in the “Previous Verifications” tab.
